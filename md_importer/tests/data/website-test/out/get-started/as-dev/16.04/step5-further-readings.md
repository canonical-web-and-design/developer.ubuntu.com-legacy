# What do to from there?

Congrats on achieving this journey with us! Do not hesitate to share this achievement by [tweeting about it](http://twitter.com/home?status="I've just completed the %23Snappy %23Ubuntu Core dev tour! https://developer.ubuntu.com/snappy/start/) or [via G+](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://developer.ubuntu.com/snappy/start/)!

## What we covered

Awesome, you learnt quite a lot in a very short period of time. You:
* Flashed your device with Snappy Ubuntu Core
* Learnt how to install new snaps to extend your device functionalities and access to those new services
* Have a basic understand of the Core principles of your new systems and how to access to some of those tools via a command line
* Created your first snap via snapcraft, just by assembling existing piece of code!

## Where to jump next?

This is of course just the start of this great Snappy Ubuntu Core journey! From there, you have mumtiple options:
* Jump straight to the code and get inspired with our [snapcraft simple examples](https://github.com/ubuntu-core/snapcraft/tree/master/examples) exploring different faces and functionalities of building on snappy. If you want to check bigger projects, we also have [some demos](https://github.com/ubuntu-core/demos) available to you!
* You want to know more about snapcraft and its features! Hope on to the [snapcraft documentation](https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/build-apps/) itself to understand its core component and life cycle!
* You can also read more [snappy documentation](https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/guides/) have a deeper understanding of the base system.
* Once you will have created your awesome applications, just [upload it to the store](https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com) for delivering it instantaneously to your users!

### Snappy Ubuntu Core Clinics

Our Snappy Ubuntu Core Clinics are video sessions where we want to inform you about what's new, show some demos, answer questions and where you can bring a problem and we are going to look at it together. [Watch the previous sessions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-qBHd6_LXWYm8qttcXaosAIzejTa5IPj) and [check the schedule](http://ubuntuonair.com/calendar) for which new ones are planned to come along and ask questions live!

### Ask a question on Ask Ubuntu

 If youâ€™re stuck on a problem, someone else has probably encountered it too and they can help you. Take a look at the "[ubuntu-core](http://askubuntu.com/questions/tagged/ubuntu-core)", "[snappy](http://askubuntu.com/questions/tagged/snappy)" or "[snapcraft](http://askubuntu.com/questions/tagged/snapcraft)" tags on Ask Ubuntu or [ask a question](http://askubuntu.com/questions/ask?tags=ubuntu-core)!

### Join our real time chat

Share your projects and ask other developers for support. This [high-bandwith IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=snappy) is a good place when you are looking for a quick answer to a single question (but be patient, not everyone is online at any time!).

### Engage with us!

App developers should subscribe or discuss about their app development or blocking issues on the dedicated [snappy-app-devel](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/snappy-app-devel) mailing list.

The [snappy-devel](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/snappy-devel) mailing list is the best place to engage in a discussion with the vast majority of people involved in the project on the base system itself.

Closely followed by all Ubuntu Core developers, both are the place of exchange, planning and problem solving.
