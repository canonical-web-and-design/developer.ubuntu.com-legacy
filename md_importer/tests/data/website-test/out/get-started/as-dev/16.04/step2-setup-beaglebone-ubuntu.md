# Setting up your Beaglebone Black

![Beaglebone Black image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubuntu-core/snappy-dev-website/master/src/img/devices/beaglebone.png "Beaglebone Black image")

From your desktop computer, you can download and install a pre-built Snappy Ubuntu Core 16.04 image for your Beaglebone Black and copy it to an SD card, USB key or external disk that you will attach and boot from. You can then get started with your project!

> Make sure your board or device is connected to the same network as your computer to manage Ubuntu Core remotely via SSH, or has a screen and keyboard attached if you prefer managing Ubuntu Core directly on the board or device.

You will flash and then insert a SD card with Ubuntu Core on it. Then, just power up your device and you are ready to go!


## Downloading and installing

1. Start by **downloading the Ubuntu Core image** for Beaglebone Black in your current folder.
```sh
wget http://people.canonical.com/~mvo/all-snaps/bbb-all-snap.img.xz
```
Once the download is finished, youâ€™ll have a zip file named bbb-all-snap.img.xz.

1. **Insert your SD card, USB card or external disk**. Ensure there is no data you care about on this disk or card before running the commands below.

1. **Unmount it**: if your SD/USB card or external disk is mounted when you insert it into your computer (you will know it if the file manager automatically opens a window showing the disk's contents), you must manually unmount it before writing the snappy image to it. Either eject your SD/USB card or external disk from the file manager, or from the command line: `sudo umount /media/$USER/`

1. **Copy your downloaded image to the SD/USB card or external disk**. You must specify the path to the disk device representing your destination disk in the dd command below. Common device paths for those are either of the form **/dev/sdX** (such as **/dev/sdb**, not /dev/sdb1!) or **/dev/mmcblk0** (not /dev/mmcblk0p1!)
```sh
xzcat bbb-all-snap.img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdX bs=32M
sync
```
 You will be prompted to enter your password after this command.

 > Note that this operation length can vary depending on your destination disk speed. There is no progress displayed unless you send SIGINFO signal pressing Ctrl+T.

1. **Eject** the SD card physically from your PC and **insert it** in your Beaglebone Black.

## First boot to Ubuntu Core 16.04

> Note that the first boot can be longer than usual as your primary disk is repartioned to take all available free space.

Power on your Beaglebone Black and wait a couple of minutes for the OS to complete its first boot.

You can then access your snappy Ubuntu Core system by loading the webdm interface from your browser. Just point it to
http://webdm.local:4200.

> Remember that if your device/cloud isn't on the same network or your vm use port redirection, adapt **webm.local** and
> the port with the appropriate external IP and ports.

Since we require our own boot loader in order to be fully compatible with Snappy, it's recommended to remove the bootloader available in the eMMC partition:
* On first boot (or each boot if you don't want to erase the bootloader available at the eMMC), you can also force it to boot to the sd card by pressing the user/boot switch button before powering up the device.
* Then, to remove the bootloader in the eMMC partition, you can run the following command on you Ubuntu Core system: `sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mmcblk1 bs=1024 count=1024`


Congrats, you just installed your new Snappy Ubuntu Core 16.04 system. It's now time to explore it and
install some snaps to it!
