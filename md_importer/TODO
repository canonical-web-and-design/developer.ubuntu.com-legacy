- fix branch indicator (devel vs. stable, 1.x vs devel, etc.)
- unpublished docs: some articles show up with a blue circle, so
  unpublished although they're accessible (not a real issue - content is
  always updated correctly)
- add comment at top of RawHTML plugins, so users know not to edit them,
  currently blocked on LP: #1523925 (RawHTML plugin strips comments)
- investigate what the api importer does (upload to swift)
